# API
This folder contains the files that I used to find the YouTube transcript of any video using the YouTubetranscript API that is found in Python.
main.py is an app which provides transcript when provided with the video key
main1.py+form.html takes a url link from the input and gives the transcript of the video by identifying the ID of the video and displays it on the browser
#please note the file form.html should be in the folder templates
